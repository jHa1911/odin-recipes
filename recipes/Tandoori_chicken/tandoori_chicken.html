    <h1>Tandoori Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../../images/tandoori_chicken.webp" alt="Cooked Tandoori Chicken">
    <h2>One of the best Indian Cuisines</h2>
    <p>
        Try this authentic tandoori chicken that's marinated in yogurt and spices, 
        then cooked on the grill instead of a clay oven so you can make it at home.
        Serve with long-grain basmati rice, grilled veggies, roasted corn on the cob,
        and a cucumber salad.
    </p>

        <li>1 1/4 cups plain yogurt </li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, mineced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>
            Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces.
            Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow 
            dish. Season chicken on both sides with lemon
            juice and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala,
            ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a
            medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food
            coloring.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover,
            and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours
            (the longer the better).
        </li>
        <li>
            When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill
            for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
            Remove chicken from marinade. Discard remaining
            marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer
            pink and the juices run clear. An instant-read
            thermometer inserted near the bone should read 
            165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges
        </li>
    </ol>
